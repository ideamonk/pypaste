README
======

pypaste.py is a python script that helps you in pasting your code on pastebin
websites without having to open a new browser window and browse for your file
or copy-paste your file.

It is as easy as this when installed -

$ pypaste index.html
http://paste.pocoo.org/show/132171/
$

Where "http://paste.pocoo.org/show/132171/" is an example output.
Which is automatically formatted for HTML syntax by PyPaste!

You'll notice that pypaste tries to do automatic syntax highlighting based on 
file extensions and highlighting supported by the service.

To hack and add more support, you should have a look at

    ./pypaste_includes.py
    ./modules/*                 --> these are service specific modules
    


INSTALL
=======

Run the install.sh script in project's root.
after that you should be able to run it easily from anywhere

$ chmod +x ./install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh

or

$ sudo sh ./install.sh
